## Website

When you visit this website, a small text file (a “cookie”) gets saved on your computer. This enables us to measure the number of visits and which pages are most read.

### This website does not show a consent banner for cookies, why?

Out tracking tool, [Matomo](https://matomo.org), is set up in compliance with the "Cookies" recommandations from the French data privacy authority, the [CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/solutions-pour-la-mesure-daudience), which allows the lack of prior consent. In particular, your IP address is anonymised before any visit is tracked.

### I contribute to your data, can I access it?

Of course! The usage data for the OpenFisca website is [public](https://stats.data.gouv.fr/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&idSite=4&period=range&date=previous30#?module=Dashboard&action=embeddedIndex&idSite=4&period=range&date=previous30&idDashboard=1).
